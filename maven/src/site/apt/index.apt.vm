  Integrating the plugin mainly consists of adding it to your <<<pom.xml>>> file along with
  dependencies on the main BugVM jars:

+-----------------+
<project>
  ...
  <dependencies>
    ...
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.bugvm</groupId>
      <artifactId>bugvm-rt</artifactId>
      <version>${project.version}</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.bugvm</groupId>
      <artifactId>bugvm-cocoatouch</artifactId>
      <version>${project.version}</version>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>com.bugvm</groupId>
        <artifactId>bugvm-maven</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
      </plugin>
      ...
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>

  Then invoke one of the above targets from the command line. For example:
  <<<mvn bugvm:ipad-sim>>>
