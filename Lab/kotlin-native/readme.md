# [Kotlin/Native](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-native)

_Kotlin/Native_ is a LLVM backend for the Kotlin compiler, runtime
implementation and native code generation facility using LLVM toolchain.

 _Kotlin/Native_ is primarily designed to allow compilation for platforms where
virtual machines are not desirable or possible (such as iOS, embedded targets),
or where developer is willing to produce reasonably-sized self-contained program
without need to ship an additional execution runtime.
